Lab 5 using MIPS assembly language on Mars compiler to create a simple ADT that can convert strings of integers in two's complement hexadecimal to an integer array. It contains functions (subroutines in mips that print the string array, convert a string to an integer, print a decimal number, using syscall 11, and converts the str to an int array, storing into memory, from memory it can also print a integer array using syscall 11. 

This program was assigned as the final project of cse12.

Notes:
I believe it works as expected and should be an A+, hopefully I didn't good up :)
