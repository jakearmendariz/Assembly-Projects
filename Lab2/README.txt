Complete with a multiplexor and adder build with basic logic gates.

Lab2 takes inputs from a keypad, adds them to one of four registers. Then it can add these inputs. Also contains a clear function. Fairly basic stuff, but a lot of implementation required. Lacks documentation on page 4,5 but I explained it on page1 of work. Thanks!
